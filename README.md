# Twitter-like-social-network-website
A Twitter-like social network website for publishing posts and following users.

## Specifications
* Users: Users can register in the website by creating an account. They can login/logout as they want.
* New post: Users who are signed in can write a new text-based post and publish it.
* All posts view: The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar takes the users to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first. Each post includes the username of the poster, the post content itself, the date and time at which the post was made, and the number of “likes” the post has.
* Profile Page: Clicking on a username loads that user’s profile page. This page shows the number of followers the user has, as well as the number of people that the user follows, all of the posts for that user in reverse chronological order and “Follow”/“Unfollow” button that will let the current user toggle whether or not they are following this user’s posts. 
* Following view: The “Following” link in the navigation bar takes the user to a page where he see all posts made by the users that the current user follows.
* Edit Post: Users can click an “Edit” button on any of their own posts to edit that post.
